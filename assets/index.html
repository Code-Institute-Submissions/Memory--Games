<p>Tetris (Russian: Тетрис [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.
 It has been published by several companies, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s. 
 After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage Tetris licensing.</p>

<p>Built on simple rules,Tetris established itself as one of the great early video games. 
The game is available on over 65 platforms, setting a Guinness world record for the most ported video game title,

Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field. 
Nearly all Tetris games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a "soft drop" and a "hard drop", respectively.
