 The design of the game was more for children to enyoj. Design of the choices wher made with this in mind:

* All icons where chosen for the obvious meaning purpose so they can be understod by everyone

#### Colours

* The primary choice of text background is colour goldenrod because they have a clear aspect while contrasting each other well with the main image on the top.

* The background for the game itself was chosen the image of milky way (universe) because it is nicely laying on the back of the game an makes you more relaxed during the play.
